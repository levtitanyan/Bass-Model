# Bass Model

## Project Overview

This project applies the **Bass Diffusion Model** to analyze and compare the adoption of the **Radio Flyer Via Pro** electric bike with traditional e-bikes. By estimating key diffusion parameters from historical e-bike adoption data, the model predicts the potential adoption curve of the Radio Flyer Via Pro, assessing its market impact and future growth trends.

## Repository Structure

- `Data/` - A folder that contains the dataset for analysis.
- `Report/` - A folder that contains the final report and the markdown source file.
- `images/` - A folder that contains visualizations generated during analysis.

## Requirements

To run the analysis, install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import scipy.optimize as opt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Reason for Comparing These Two Innovations

The Radio Flyer Via Pro builds upon the success of traditional electric bikes by introducing a premium family-friendly design with enhanced features like a powerful motor, long-range battery, and cargo capacity. While early e-bikes focused on individual riders and urban commuting, the Via Pro targets families, offering a sustainable alternative to cars for short-distance travel. As the e-bike market matures, this new segment has potential for growth as urban mobility trends favor eco-friendly and practical transport solutions.

Scope of Analysis

For this analysis, I have chosen the United States as the scope for diffusion modeling. The U.S. is one of the fastest-growing e-bike markets, driven by increasing consumer interest in sustainable transportation and supportive government policies. Additionally, Radio Flyer is a well-known American brand, making the U.S. an ideal market to analyze adoption trends. By focusing on the U.S., the study leverages reliable market data, consumer trends, and historical e-bike adoption patterns to make accurate diffusion predictions for the Via Pro.

## Conclusions

The graph illustrates the **Bass Diffusion Model fit** for product adoption. The **blue dots** represent observed adoption data, while the **red line** shows the modelâ€™s prediction.

### **Adoption Phases:**
- **Early Adoption (0-2 years):** Slow growth driven by innovators.
- **Rapid Growth (2-7 years):** Adoption accelerates due to imitation effects.
- **Peak Adoption (~8-9 years):** Market reaches saturation.
- **Decline Phase (After 9 years):** Adoption slows as potential adopters decrease.

The model aligns well with the data, accurately capturing the **adoption trend**. It can be used for **future adoption forecasting and strategic planning**.
